    <p> 
        Shokupan is a Japanese-style bread that is known for its soft and fluffy texture. It is made using high-quality wheat flour, 
        yeast, sugar, salt, and milk, which gives it a slightly sweet flavor and a moist crumb. Shokupan is typically baked in a 
        rectangular loaf shape and has a light, airy texture that makes it perfect for sandwiches or simply enjoyed on its own. This 
        bread has become a popular staple in Japan and is now enjoyed by many people around the world.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        ------------------------------------------
    </p>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>540 g Bread flour</li>
        <li>220 g Whole Milk</li>
        <li>140 g Heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 Large egg</li>
        <li>50 g Sugar</li>
        <li>6 g Instant Dry Yeast</li>
        <li>5 g Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine all the listed ingredients except for the salt.</li>
        <li>After adding all the ingredients, add the salt in.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough until you achieve the 'screen door' effect on the dough where it becomes translucent enough to see light.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a clean bowl and cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two equal portions and divide each of those into three balls.</li>
        <li>Roll each of the balls (there should be 6) into an oval and fold the sides in; flatten the dough then roll them up and place three of them into a pullman loaf pan</li>
        <li>Place the dough in greased loaf pans and cover them with a damp cloth. Let them rise again in a warm place for 30-60 minutes until they have risen to the top of the pans.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 392°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Bake the loaves in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the loaves from the oven and remove them from the pan to let it cool</li>
        <li>Once the loaves are cool, slice and serve as desired.</li>
      </ol>

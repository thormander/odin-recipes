    <h1>Shokupan Pizza Toast</h1>
    <img src="../images/PizzaToast.jpg">
    <p> 
        Shokupan pizza toast is a delicious and easy-to-make dish that features thick slices of Shokupan bread topped with pizza sauce, 
        cheese, and other toppings of your choice. The Shokupan bread provides a soft and fluffy base for the pizza toppings, while the 
        sauce and cheese add a savory and gooey layer of flavor. The toppings can vary depending on your preferences, but common options 
        include diced vegetables, sliced meats, and herbs. The pizza toasts are typically broiled in the oven until the cheese is melted 
        and bubbly, making for a warm and satisfying meal or snack.

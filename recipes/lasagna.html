        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, a tomato-based sauce, 
        and a mixture of cheese, typically including ricotta and mozzarella. The layers are typically repeated several times, 
        creating a hearty and savory casserole-like dish that is often baked in the oven until the cheese on top is melted and bubbly. 
        Additional ingredients such as ground meat, vegetables, or herbs may also be added to the layers to enhance the flavor and 
        texture of the dish.
